Masse Spy
So… you got accepted onto the Masse Spy team. What do you do?
Well, to quote the CDC ... “[being a Masse Spy] is a rapidly changing situation”. So you never know! But here are the basics: 
1. Observe what’s going on in class - look for suspicious behavior 
2. Go undercover as a Supervillain - available for those approved by the Ambassadors 
3. Be the decoy agent - see above
4. Contact Roshni or Monique for any information as a “neutral” person - check in with Ella and Eric because if everyone did it would be sus
5. Check the 7th Grader hangout if they invited you. 
6. Attend meetings and reply in the chat if you have Google Hangouts.
Sub note by Eric: These meetings can be chat sessions if you’d like. No one is being forced to attend a live meeting.
